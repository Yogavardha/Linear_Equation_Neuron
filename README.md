## Introduction

The **Linear Equation Neuron** framework utilizes principles from artificial intelligence and neural networks to efficiently solve systems of linear equations. This approach leverages Gaussian elimination, a method known for its effectiveness in linear algebra, and incorporates back substitution to provide accurate solutions.

This repository serves as a resource for students, educators, and developers interested in both the mathematical and computational aspects of linear equations. By using this framework, you can deepen your understanding of how neurons can be modeled to perform complex calculations.

## Features

- **Gaussian Elimination**: The core algorithm that simplifies systems of equations.
- **Back Substitution**: An essential step to find the final solutions after applying Gaussian elimination.
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend and integrate into other projects.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples to help you get started.
- **Performance**: Optimized for speed and accuracy.

## Getting Started

To get started with the **Linear Equation Neuron**, you need to clone the repository and set up your environment.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy library
- Basic understanding of linear algebra

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yogavardha/Linear_Equation_Neuron.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Linear_Equation_Neuron
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy
   ```

4. Download the latest release from our [Releases section](https://github.com/Yogavardha/Linear_Equation_Neuron/releases). Execute the downloaded file to start using the framework.

## Usage

Hereâ€™s how you can use the **Linear Equation Neuron** framework to solve a system of linear equations.

### Example

Suppose you have the following system of equations:

```
2x + 3y = 8
3x + 4y = 11
```

You can represent this system in matrix form as:

```
A = [[2, 3],
     [3, 4]]

B = [8, 11]
```

You can solve for `x` and `y` using the framework as follows:

```python
import numpy as np
from linear_equation_neuron import solve_linear_system

A = np.array([[2, 3], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([8, 11])

solution = solve_linear_system(A, B)
print("The solution is:", solution)
```
